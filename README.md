== new-options README

Synoposis 

This is a sample rails app done for my Basic Rails App checkpoint. After reviewing the rails new --help documentation, I decide to include the Javascript (-j) option with this new app.  It is preconfigured for selected Javascript libraries.   




This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...


Please feel free to use a different markup language if you do not plan to run
<tt>rake doc:app</tt>.
